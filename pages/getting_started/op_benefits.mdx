# Increased Efficiency for Users

Users benefit from faster transaction processing and lower fees compared to directly transacting on the Ethereum network.

# Ethereum Compatibility 

A key advantage of Optimism is its compatibility with Ethereum's existing smart contracts and dApps. This means developers can migrate their applications to Optimism without significant changes to the code.

# Enhancing Ethereum's Scalability

Layer 2 solutions like Optimism are integral to Ethereum's scalability strategy. They provide an immediate relief to the scalability issues, while Ethereum continues to develop long-term solutions like sharding in its transition to Ethereum 2.0.
