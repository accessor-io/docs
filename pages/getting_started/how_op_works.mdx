# Optimistic Rollups 

Optimism uses a technology called "Optimistic Rollups". This approach assumes transactions are valid by default, thus requiring less computational power. Only in the case of a challenge or dispute, the system performs a computation to verify the transaction.

# Reducing Gas Fees and Increasing Throughput

By handling transactions off-chain, Optimism drastically reduces the gas fees associated with transactions. Additionally, this method increases transaction throughput since the main Ethereum chain is not bogged down by every single transaction.

# Batching Transactions

Optimism aggregates multiple off-chain transactions into batches and submits them to the Ethereum network. This batching process further enhances efficiency and scalability.
