# Pause and Unpause the Bridge

This guide explains how to pause `OptimismPortal` as a backup safety mechanism on your OP Stack chain.

## Why do it?

The `OptimismPortal` is a bridge contract that makes it possible to send messages between your L1 and your L2 OP Stack chain. 
The `OptimismPortal` is pausable as a backup safety mechanism that allows a specific `GUARDIAN` address to temporarily halt deposits and withdrawals to mitigate security issues if necessary. 
An OP Stack chain does not have to specify a usable `GUARDIAN` address if it does not want to make the `OptimismPortal` contract pausable, it can specify an address such as zero.


## Who can do it?

[`OptimismPortal`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/129032f15b76b0d2a940443a39433de931a97a44/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol) has an immutable `GUARDIAN`. 
That address can call [`pause`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/129032f15b76b0d2a940443a39433de931a97a44/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L171-L178) and [`unpause`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/129032f15b76b0d2a940443a39433de931a97a44/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L180-L187).


### Changing the guardian

The guardian created by the setup script is the admin account.
This is sufficient for testing, but for a production system you would want the guardian to be a multisig with trusted security council.

The `GUARDIAN` variable is immutable, but the `OptimismPortal` contract sits behind a proxy, so the `GUARDIAN` can be modified by changing the `OptimismPortal` proxy to point to a new implementation contract.
You do this using the L1 [`ProxyAdmin`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/129032f15b76b0d2a940443a39433de931a97a44/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/ProxyAdmin.sol) contract.
