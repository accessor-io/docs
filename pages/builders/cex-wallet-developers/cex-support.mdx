# Add OP Mainnet to Your Centralized Exchange

This comprehensive guide is designed to assist you in seamlessly integrating OP Mainnet into your Centralized Exchange. It covers every aspect from establishing a connection to OP Mainnet, to handling deposits and withdrawals, and even accessing vital audit reports.

## Connect to OP Mainnet


Connecting to OP Mainnet is analogous to connecting to Ethereum, with the use of a JSON RPC endpoint. This section walks you through the necessary steps and considerations.

You connect to OP Mainnet the same way you do to Ethereum, by connecting to a JSON RPC endpoint.

### Endpoints

You can choose between our public endpoints, which are rate limited, and endpoints from [infrastructure providers](/chain/networks). Given rate throughput limits, we recommend using a private rpc provider for both mainnet and testnet use cases.

### ETH balance

ETH is used precisely the way it is used in L1 Ethereum.

### Token addresses

The ERC-20 contract address for a token on OP Mainnet may be different from the address for the same token on Ethereum. [The list of tokens and their addresses is here](https://static.optimism.io/optimism.tokenlist.json).

For example, looking at the **SNX** token, we get these addresses:

| ChainID | Network                  | Address                                    |
| ------: | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
|       1 | Ethereum                 | 0xc011a73ee8576fb46f5e1c5751ca3b9fe0af2a6f |
|      10 | OP Mainnet               | 0x8700daec35af8ff88c16bdf0418774cb3d7599b4 |
|       5 | Goerli (test network)    | 0x51f44ca59b867E005e48FA573Cb8df83FC7f7597 |
|     420 | OP Goerli (test network) | 0x2E5ED97596a8368EB9E44B1f3F25B2E813845303 |

To get the total SNX balance of a user that uses OP Mainnet you need to:

1.  Connect to a standard Ethereum endpoint and send a `balanceOf` query to address `0xc011a73ee8576fb46f5e1c5751ca3b9fe0af2a6f`.
2.  Connect to an OP Mainnet endpoint and send a `balanceOf` query to address `0x8700daec35af8ff88c16bdf0418774cb3d7599b4`.


### Detailed Steps for Connection:

1. **Choosing Endpoints**: 
   - **Public Endpoints**: These are readily available but come with rate limits.
   - **Private RPC Providers**: For more robust performance, especially under high demand, private providers are recommended. [List of supported providers](/chain/op-networks).

2. **Understanding ETH Operations**: 
   - ETH functions in the same manner as it does on Ethereum L1, serving as the primary transactional currency.

3. **Handling Token Addresses**:
   - Note that the ERC-20 contract addresses for tokens may vary between Ethereum and OP Mainnet. [Access the comprehensive token list here](https://static.optimism.io/optimism.tokenlist.json).
   - Example with SNX Token:
     - Ethereum Address: `0xc011a73ee8576fb46f5e1c5751ca3b9fe0af2a6f`
     - OP Mainnet Address: `0x8700daec35af8ff88c16bdf0418774cb3d7599b4`
     - To calculate a user's total SNX balance on OP Mainnet, perform `balanceOf` queries on both the Ethereum and OP Mainnet addresses.

## Managing Deposits and Withdrawals within OP Mainnet

This section explains how the ERC-20 contracts on OP Mainnet mirror those on Ethereum, allowing for a familiar operation of withdrawals and deposits.

### In-depth on Transaction Fees:
- While OP Mainnet transactions themselves are typically low-cost (often under 0.001 gwei per gas), the significant part of the cost comes from recording these transactions on Ethereum.
- These costs are automatically subtracted from the user's balance on OP Mainnet, which is an important consideration when setting fees for your users. [Detailed fee structure and considerations](/stack/transaction-fees/overview).

## Cross-Chain Deposits and Withdrawals

### Utilizing Bridges for Asset Transfers:
- **Standard Gateway**: Our gateway facilitates the transfer of assets between L1 (Ethereum mainnet) and OP Mainnet. It mints equivalent assets on OP Mainnet upon receiving assets on L1, and reversely, burns assets on L2 and releases them on L1 for withdrawals. This process is crucial for maintaining a balanced asset flow. [Gateway usage guide](https://app.optimism.io/bridge).
- **Withdrawal Timeframes**: Keep in mind that while transferring from L1 to L2 is typically swift, the reverse transaction requires a [seven-day challenge period](https://help.optimism.io/hc/en-us/articles/4411895558171), due to security protocols.

### Alternative Bridging Solutions:
- **Third-Party Bridges**: These can offer expedited withdrawals by relying on liquidity pools and support multiple L2 chains. However, they might have a more limited selection of tokens and potentially less decentralization compared to our standard gateway. [Explore third-party bridge options](https://www.optimism.io/apps/bridges).

## Accessing Audit Reports for Enhanced Security

- Ensuring the security of transactions and operations on the blockchain is paramount. We provide an exhaustive list of audit reports for your perusal, offering transparency and insights into the security measures in place.
